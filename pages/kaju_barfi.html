			<dt><strong><em>Ingredients:</em></strong></dt>
			<dt></dt>
			<dd>
				<ul>
					<li>160 grams cashews</li>
					<li>100 grams sugar</li>
					<li>5 tablespoons water</li>
					<li>1 tablespoon Ghee</li>

					<dt>Grinding cashews:</dt>
					<dd>
						<ol>
							<li>Powder the cashew in a coffee grinder, blender or a dry grinder.</li>
							<li>The cashews should be in powdered form and not become pasty or oily.</li>
						</ol>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>Making dough:</dt>
					<dd>
						<ol>
							<li>On a low flame heat sugar and water in a thick bottomed or non stick pan or kadai.</li>
							<li>Meanwhile grease a plate or a tray and keep aside or keep butter papers ready.</li>
							<li>When all the sugar has dissolved in the water, add the cashew powder. There is no consistency in the sugar syrup required like one string or two string. Just let the sugar dissolve in the water and then proceed with the next step.</li>
							<li>Mix and keep on stirring the cashew mixture non-stop on a low flame.</li>
							<li>The cashew mixture would start thickening.</li>
							<li>Cook the kaju mixture for approx 7 to 9 minutes until the whole dough starts to come together.</li>
						</ol>
					</dd>

					<dt>Making Kaju Katli:</dt>
					<dd>
						<ol>
							<li>Remove the whole lump of the kaju dough from the pan and place it on your work surface or in a bowl or plate.</li>
							<li>Add the rose petals and ghee or oil to the cashew mixture.</li>
							<li>When the heat in the dough is hot enough to handle, then knead the cashew mixture lightly.</li>
							<li>Flatten the dough and place it on a butter paper or on a greased plate or tray.</li>
							<li>Place a butter paper on top and then using a rolling pin, roll gently the dough from all sides till you reach a thickness of 3 to 5 mm in the dough.</li>
							<li>Remove the butter paper and let the rolled dough cool.</li>
							<li>When completely cooled, using a sharp knife cut the cashew dough giving square or diamond shapes.</li>
							<li>Gently remove the kaju barfi with a butter knife.</li>
							<li>Serve the kaju katli straight away or keep in an airtight container.</li>
